## Approach

1. **Write Section 1 + 2 first** (Getting Started + Bookings) — this covers onboarding and the core workflow
2. **Then Section 3** (Barcode & Labels) — new features, high support demand
3. **Then Sections 4-9** in priority order
4. **Sections 10-12 last** — lower traffic, admin-only, one-time setup
5. **Screenshots:** Each guide needs screenshots. Capture from the live production app.
6. **Review cycle:** After each section, test with a new user — can they complete the tasks from the guide alone?
